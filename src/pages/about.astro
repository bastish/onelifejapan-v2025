        <p>
            <span class="emph">Since 2005</span>, we've helped travelers venture beyond the bullet train stops and
            glossy postcards, into <span class="emph">lesser-visited rural areas</span> where life unfolds at a slower pace.
            <span class="emph">One Life Japan is based in the countryside</span> we explore, and our roots in the region
            run deep. We're not just passing through - we live here, work here, and <span class="emph">
                know the backroads, the seasons, and the people
            </span> who shape the rhythm of everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our trips introduce not just places, but the<span class="emph"> people and everyday culture</span> that make
            them meaningful. For us, the magic lies in <span class="emph">shared moments with locals</span>,
            breathtaking vistas far from the main roads, and the <span class="emph"
                >unexpected stories that unfold along the way</span
            >.
        </p>

        <div class="centered" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
            <IsItForYou show="modal" />
        </div>
        <p>
            <span class="emph">Each trip is custom-designed</span> to match your pace and travel style. Whether it's a two-day
            countryside break, a one-week Bike & Hike challenge, a relaxed family adventure, or a one-month culture and language
            immersion for students - we build each trip to fit the people taking it.<span class="emph">
                We love a good challenge</span
            >, whether it's physical or about opening perspectives,<span class="emph">
                but we always keep it within reach</span
            >.
        </p>

        <p>
            We believe that travel is not just about what you see, but how you experience it. Our programs are built to
            reveal the <span class="emph">meaning and relationships</span> behind Japan’s cultural and natural heritage—through
            first-hand encounters with landscapes, traditions, and communities. The goal isn’t just to see rural Japan, but
            to feel a connection to it as place.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our home base - and <span class="emph">the region we know best</span> - is in Northern Nagano: Iiyama, Nozawa
            Onsen Village, Sakae Mura, Kijima Daira, and Tsunan Town.<span class="emph">
                We travel by bike and on foot</span
            >, not to rack up kilometers, but because they’re the <span class="emph"
                >best way to stay grounded and explore deeply</span
            >. For longer distances, we mix in trains or transfers to keep the rhythm balanced. E-bikes are available
            for those who want to <span class="emph">keep things active but accessible</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            We don't dictate where to look or rush you through a checklist. Instead,<span class="emph">
                we create space for exploration</span
            >, adjusting to your interests and giving you the <span class="emph"
                >confidence to wander without worry</span
            >. Even if you do get a little "lost," you're never truly lost—we’re there to back you up, not hold your
            hand.
        </p>

        <p>
            For many visitors, the "where" is already decided. <span class="emph"
                >What makes a trip meaningful is the "how"</span
            > - the time in between the sights. The landscapes you move through. The strangers who become characters in <span
                class="emph"
            >
                your story
            </span>. That’s where we focus.
        </p>

        <!-- 

        <p>
            We have <span class="emph">twenty years of experience</span> helping people venture into lesser visited rural
            areas - <span class="emph">since 2005</span> - between the bullet train stops and beyond the postcards and tourist
            hotspots, <span class="emph">introducing the people, places, and lifestyle and culture</span>. For us it's
            about the <span class="emph">moments shared with locals</span>, and in the breathtaking vistas that await
            off the main roads and the stories that unfold long the way - slowing down and eperince it in a <span
                class="emph">relaxed, active, and adventureful way</span
            > on foot or by bicycle.
        </p>

        <div class="centered" style="margin-bottom:50px;">
            <h2 class="emph">Our adventures are custom made to fit your travel style.</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            We have trips to fit most needs and schedules, such as 2-days in the countryside, a challenging 1-week Bike
            & Hike, 4 and 5 day family trips, and even a 1-month Japan language & culture immersion course for students.
            We thrive on challenge - physical challenge as well as challenging pre-held beliefs, but strive to make sure
            the challenge is not too much for the individual.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our programs are designed to communicate and reveal meanings and relationships of cultural and natural
            heritage to the public, through first hand involvement with an object, artifact, landscape, monument or
            site. Through this we aim to forge an emotional and intellectual connection between the interests of
            participants and the meanings inherent in the cultural resource being studied.
        </p>
        <IsItForYou show="collapse" />

        <p>
            We want to <span class="emph">help you to explore</span>, not to dictate exactly what you should look at and
            adhere to strict time schedules. We <span class="emph">go with the flow and adjust</span> according to your interest.
            We <span class="emph">facilitate interaction with locals</span>, and ensure that <span class="emph"
                >even if you do get "lost", you will never be truly lost</span
            >, allowing you to explore without worry.
        </p>

        <p>
            For many people, especially first time travelers, the where to go is pretty much set. The way to make your
            trip unique is to start thinking about the how to get there. The itineraries I see are all about points, but
            no one discusses what will happing in the time - a huge chuknk of time in Japan - as you travel between
            those points. 2/3 of your trip. [represenation of how much of each day is spend at "attractions" vs "travel"
            vs in-between interactions]
        </p>

        <p>
            We travel by <span class="emph">bicycle and on foot</span>, but the main focus is not to log as many
            kilometers as possible, rather bicycle and walking are simply the preferred mode of travel <span
                class="emph">to allow you to keep it slow</span
            >, so you can enjoy the area. While not opposed to some challenge, to <span class="emph"
                >keep a focus on adventure</span
            >, We provide e-assist bicycles in addtion to regular cross bikes. When the distances between locations are
            too far to allow a relaxing ride or walk, alternative transportation is available to <span class="emph"
                >provide shortcuts</span
            > to ensure your cycling or walking time is spent in the best locations.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can plan and faclitate adventures in the <span class="emph">countless rural areas across Japan</span>,
            but our <span class="emph">base, main playground, and the community we know best</span>, and can make you

        <h3>About Your Facilitator</h3>

        <br />

        <p>
            Kevin has spent <span class="emph">30 years living, working, and exploring Japan</span> - from the islands of
            Kyushu and Shikoku to the streets of Tokyo. In 2006, he and his wife moved to a <span class="emph">
                rural village in Northern Nagano’s Snow Country
            </span>, where he began farming rice, shoveling snow, and guiding tours as One Life Japan. Becoming <span
                class="emph"
            >
                part of a rural community and living daily life there
            </span> has given him rare insight into a side of Japan that few visitors ever see - something that can’t be
            fully understood without being rooted in it. Through One Life Japan, he <span class="emph"
                >shares that local knowledge and everyday connection</span
            > with travelers looking for something deeper than a checklist of sights.
        </p>

        <p>
            He has traveled extensively by <span class="emph">foot, bike, train, ferry, and even hitchhiking</span> - leading
            adventures from subtropical coastlines to Japan’s highest peaks, through blizzards, typhoons, and golden rice
            fields. Along the way, he’s developed <span class="emph">a knack for finding the path</span> that leads to something
            special.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kevin speaks both <span class="emph">English and Japanese</span> and has a natural way of connecting with locals
            - whether chatting with farmers in mountain dialects or finding the perfect roadside udon spot.
        </p>
        <p>His background includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sea kayak instructor in Maine</li>
            <li>Outward Bound outdoor education instructor training in the US and Japan</li>
            <li>Outward Bound Japan field instructor</li>
            <li>Canyoning guide in Nagano</li>
            <li>Trained as a Wilderness First Responder</li>
            <li>Ogranic Rice Farmer</li>
            <li>Volunteer Fire Brigade</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Before settling in the countryside, Kevin worked in Tokyo in finance and web development. After earning a
            Master’s in Sustainability Studies in Sweden, he joined one of Japan’s leading sustainability consultancies.
            During the pandemic, when Japan was closed to tourism, he took a break from guiding to teach preschool and
            kindergarten - something that <span class="emph">keeps him young</span> and adds a <span class="emph"
                >little extra magic to family trips</span
            >. He draws on all of these experiences to create grounded, meaningful adventures that <span class="emph">
                connect people with place
            </span> - often with a few unexpected moments of real-life hospitality along the way.
        </p>

        <!-- Kevin has been <span
                class="emph">living, studying, working, and adventuring in Japan for nearly thirty years</span
            >, having lived in Kyushu, Shikoku and Tokyo before he and his wife <span class="emph"
                >moved to a small rural village</span
            > in Northern Nagano's Snow Country in 2006 to begin <span class="emph"
                >farming rice, shoveling snow, and guiding rural tours as One Life Japan.</span
            > -->
        <!-- 
        <p>
            With an uncanny ability to intuit which path will lead to <span class="emph">the next great adventure</span
            >, <span class="emph">community ties, personal experience, and careful research</span>, trip planning, and
            preparation. Kevin speaks <span class="emph">Japanese and English</span>, with the ability to charm even the
            most serious of local farmers into a conversation about politics, food, or most often, life in the
            mountains.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="emph">Kevin has jounreyed extensivly</span> around Japan by foot, bicycle, van, train, ferry, and
            even hitchiking. He has led adventures from the <span class="emph">islands ofKyushu</span>, to the <span
                class="emph">summit of Japan's highest mountains</span
            >, through blzzards and typhoons.
        </p>

        <p>In addition to leading 0ne Life Japan Hike, Bike and Walking Tours, Kevin's resume includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sea kayak instructor in Maine</li>
            <li>Outward Bound outdoor education instructor training in the US and Japan</li>
            <li>Outward Bound Japan field instructor</li>
            <li>Canyoning guide in Nagano</li>
            <li>Trained as a Wilderness First Responder</li>
            <li>Ogranic Rice Farmer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Still, his passion is for the less extreme, slow paced realxing <span class="emph"
                >adventures that connect people with place</span
            >, and when his mojo is working, he has been known to even work in an unplanned home-cooked dinner and peek
            into the real life of the locals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kevin is trained as an <span class="emph">American Wilderness First Responder</span>, and an <span
                class="emph">Outward Bound Japan instructor</span
            >. In a previous life, before making the leap to rural life, Kevin worked in Tokyo for a major Japanese
            finance firm, and in web development. After receiving a Masters Degree in Sustainability Studies in Sweden,
            he worked for one of Japan's leading Sustainability Consultancy in Tokyo. He draws on these past
            regular-life experiences in Japan to inform his current lust for travel.

            The journey is as much about discovering new landscapes as it is about rediscovering ourselves. Whether

            our tours; you’re like family, and part of a community of explorers, dreamers, and storytellers. - Kevin
