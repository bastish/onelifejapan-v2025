            <span class="emph">Since 2005</span>, we've helped travelers venture beyond the bullet train stops and
            glossy postcards, into <span class="emph">lesser-visited rural areas</span> where life unfolds at a slower pace.
            <span class="emph">One Life Japan is based in the countryside</span> we explore, and our roots in the region
            run deep. We're not just passing through - we live here, work here, and <span class="emph">
                know the backroads, the seasons, and the people
            </span> who shape the rhythm of everyday life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our trips introduce not just places, but the<span class="emph"> people and everyday culture</span> that make
            them meaningful. For us, the magic lies in <span class="emph">shared moments with locals</span>,
            breathtaking vistas far from the main roads, and the <span class="emph"
                >unexpected stories that unfold along the way</span
            >.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="emph">Each trip is custom-designed</span> to match your pace and travel style. Whether it's a <a
                href="/itinerary/4/3-days-off-the-path/"
                title="Short Rural Immersian in Japan">two-day countryside break</a

                >relaxed family adventure</a
            >, or a one-month culture and language immersion for students - we build each trip to fit the people taking
            it.<span class="emph"> We love a good challenge</span>, whether it's physical or about opening perspectives,<span
                class="emph"
            >
                but we always keep it within reach</span
            >.
        </p>

        <p>
            We believe that travel is not just about what you see, but how you experience it. Our programs are built to
            reveal the <span class="emph">meaning and relationships</span> behind Japan’s cultural and natural heritage—through
            first-hand encounters with landscapes, traditions, and communities. The goal isn’t just to see rural Japan, but
            to feel a connection to it as place.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our home base - and <span class="emph">the region we know best</span> - is in Northern Nagano: Iiyama, Nozawa
            Onsen Village, Sakae Mura, Kijima Daira, and Tsunan Town.<span class="emph">
                We travel by bike and on foot</span
            >, not to rack up kilometers, but because they’re the <span class="emph"
                >best way to stay grounded and explore deeply</span
            >. For longer distances, we mix in trains or transfers to keep the rhythm balanced. E-bikes are available
            for those who want to <span class="emph">keep things active but accessible</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            We don't dictate where to look or rush you through a checklist. Instead,<span class="emph">
                we create space for exploration</span
            >, adjusting to your interests and giving you the <span class="emph"
                >confidence to wander without worry</span
            >. Even if you do get a little "lost," you're never truly lost—we’re there to back you up, not hold your
            hand.
        </p>

        <p>
            For many visitors, the "where" is already decided. <span class="emph"
                >What makes a trip meaningful is the "how"</span
            > - the time in between the sights. The landscapes you move through. The strangers who become characters in <span
                class="emph"
            >
                your story
            </span>. That’s where we focus.

        <h3>About Your Facilitator</h3>

        <br />

        <p>
            Kevin has spent <span class="emph">30 years living, working, and exploring Japan</span> - from the islands of
            Kyushu and Shikoku to the streets of Tokyo. In 2006, he and his wife moved to a <span class="emph">
                rural village in Northern Nagano’s Snow Country
            </span>, where he began farming rice, shoveling snow, and guiding tours as One Life Japan. Becoming <span
                class="emph"
            >
                part of a rural community and living daily life there
            </span> has given him rare insight into a side of Japan that few visitors ever see - something that can’t be
            fully understood without being rooted in it. Through One Life Japan, he <span class="emph"
                >shares that local knowledge and everyday connection</span
            > with travelers looking for something deeper than a checklist of sights.
        </p>

        <div class="frame about-right">
            <GenericSlider sliderImageId={22} height={200} />
        </div>
        <p>
            He has traveled extensively by <span class="emph">foot, bike, train, ferry, and even hitchhiking</span> - leading
            adventures from subtropical coastlines to Japan’s highest peaks, through blizzards, typhoons, and golden rice
            fields. Along the way, he’s developed <span class="emph">a knack for finding the path</span> that leads to something
            special.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kevin speaks both <span class="emph">English and Japanese</span> and has a natural way of connecting with locals
            - whether chatting with farmers in mountain dialects or finding the perfect roadside udon spot.
        </p>
        <p>His background includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sea kayak instructor in Maine</li>
            <li>Outward Bound outdoor education instructor training in the US and Japan</li>
            <li>Outward Bound Japan field instructor</li>
            <li>Canyoning guide in Nagano</li>
            <li>Trained as a Wilderness First Responder</li>
            <li>Ogranic Rice Farmer</li>
            <li>Volunteer Fire Brigade</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Before settling in the countryside, Kevin worked in Tokyo in finance and web development. After earning a
            Master’s in Sustainability Studies in Sweden, he joined one of Japan’s leading sustainability consultancies.
            During the pandemic, when Japan was closed to tourism, he took a break from guiding to teach preschool and
            kindergarten - something that <span class="emph">keeps him young</span> and adds a <span class="emph"
                >little extra magic to family trips</span
            >. He draws on all of these experiences to create grounded, meaningful adventures that <span class="emph">
                connect people with place
            </span> - often with a few unexpected moments of real-life hospitality along the way.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Kevin was instrumental in all our very special memories of the most fantastic Japan experiences. Hoping we
            can come visit you guys soon.

        <blockquote>
            Kristina and me went on a bike tour with Kevin 10 years ago (wow time flies!) and it remains my favorite
            ever trip
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            The journey is as much about discovering new landscapes as it is about rediscovering ourselves. Whether
            you’re cruising on a bike, exploring on foot, or simply soaking in a hot bath, you’re not just a guest on
            our tours; you’re like family, and part of a community of explorers, dreamers, and storytellers. - Kevin
