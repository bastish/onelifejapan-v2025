                        pick them up for you). We can make sure you have proper gear needed, your luggage is forwarded

                        Its not just about getting off the beaten path. In fact, the beaten path is beaten for a reason.
                        The destinatons are great. That is why people go there. We focud more on finding the value in
                        the *getting there*. Kyoto is great. Kanazawa is great. What's in between? Ever wonder what is
                        happening in those small towns that flash by the train window as you shuttle from hot-spot to
                        hot-spot? We don't try to eliminate the hot spots, we just want to see what is between them.

                        It's never too late to consider book. While booking ahead of time gives more time to plan, and
                        ensure more options for accommodations, the whole point is adventure, and spur of the moment

                        bill. If not, we can try to do adjustments
