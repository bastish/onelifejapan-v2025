                <p>
                    We‚Äôve been guiding visitors through Japan‚Äôs countryside for 20 years - from family-friendly bike
                    trips to solo hiking journeys. We help people build custom experiences outside the tourist zones,
                    without needing to join a group, speak Japanese, or spend a fortune.

                    <li>‚úÖ Quiet towns, not tourist crowds</li>

                    <li>‚úÖ 3 days to one month</li>
                    <li>‚úÖ Clear pricing - with no surprise upsells</li>

                <p>
                    Some of our guests swap in one of our trips instead of a day in Hakone, Shirakawago, or Kanazawa.
                    Others add a short self-guided detour between Tokyo and Kyoto.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting off the golden route for a few days is easier than you think. Sure Takayama, Kanazawa
                    Shirakawago are popular alternative destinations, but those are still not quite rural Japan. Magome
                    and Tsumago are tourist-rural that is they are out of the city, but still highly dependent on
                    tourism. That is great, nd we like to go there too, One life Japan will help you get to the real
                    rural areas where tourims is not the main industry. we can work in Tsumago + more rural.

                    Our tours can be short enough to fit accommodate the rest of your tirp. Other companeis are 7, 8 or
                    even 11 days. We depart in the morning and finish in the evening. Does not include meeting as one
                    day, or wake up and depart as one day. Most tours say 8 days, but day 1 is meeting at the hotel the
                    night before, and the day 8 is wake up and depart form hotel. They start in Tokyo and end in Tokyo
                    include the hotel beore and after. We are happy to help you decide on a place to stay, but that is
                    not considered part of your jounrey with us. You trip starts early in the morning (or as early as
                    you can meet us) and goes until as late are you want on the last day. We will plan in in a way that
                    you arrive at a convenient station. We think you can handleTokyo on your own and are cabpable of
                    geting to the starting point so we do not have to include transporation form the city to the start

                        Unlike many tours that run fixed 9- or 11-day itineraries (often starting with a meet-up in
                        Tokyo and ending with a hotel checkout), our trips are fully custom - which means:
                    </li>

                    <li>Every day is a full day of travel - no filler days, no wasted time.</li>

                    <li>Start where it makes sense, not just where everyone else does.</li>

                    <li>End at a convenient station, with a smooth transition to your next destination.</li>

                    Most tours include a bit of handholding. We think you are capable of navigating yourself, so you

                    Want a bike tour that doesn‚Äôt go to Kanazawa, Hakone, or Takayama? Good. Because I don‚Äôt offer
                    those. I‚Äôve spent 20 years designing rural bike trips that show you the side of Japan that
                    influencers don‚Äôt photograph. From onsen villages with zero tourists, to valleys you‚Äôve never heard
                    of, I plan fully custom trips for families, couples, and solo travelers - from light rides with
                    cultural stops to full-on bikepacking. No crowds. No buses. Just bikes, maps, mountains, and me.

                    One way trip - ride from Kyoto and meet up with your luggage two or three or four days later at a
                    conveniencet train station of your choosing.
