    Because each trip is custom, it can be as easygoing or as challenging as you like. Our goal is to make
    <span class="emph">hard-to-reach areas of Japan accessible</span> to as many people as possible - regardless of age,
    fitness level, or past experience.
</p>

<p>
    Here are a few examples of the kinds of days we can plan. We’ll work with you to find the right balance of activity,
    comfort, and adventure for everyone in your group:
</p>

<ul class="checklist">
    <li>
        <h5>Relaxing</h5>
        <p>
            Most of our trips include some form of movement - a bit of walking, a ride through the countryside - but
            we’re not here to prove anything. Some days are made for taking it slow.
        </p>
        <p>
            The riding or walking doesn't have to be the focus. We want people of all ages and abilities to enjoy rural
            Japan and see places they otherwise wouldn’t. That said, many of these areas aren’t packed with typical
            tourist attractions, so if you’re not moving much, the pace will be slow - and that’s part of the charm. <span
                class="emph">"So… what’s next?"</span
            > is a forbidden question.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Relax and Wander</h5>
        <p>
            Sometimes even a bicycle feels too fast. Some places deserve a few hours on foot, just to wander, chat with
            locals, or explore hidden corners at your own pace. There’s no pressure to cover ground - we might get
            happily “stuck” in a museum or soak for hours in a local bathhouse. <span class="emph"
                >This is the trip where the goal is to have no goal.</span
            >
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Full-Day Walk, Relaxed Pace</h5>
        <p>
            A day spent walking from A to B - taking in the landscape, stopping at shrines, cafés, or a waterfall along
            the way. The pace is easy, and the route will be tailored to your level.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Full-Day Ride, Relaxed Pace</h5>
        <p>
            We’ll cover more ground by bike - maybe 30 to 60 km depending on the terrain - with stops for photos,
            snacks, and any unexpected discoveries. Yes, there may be a hill or two to push up, but we’ll take it slow
            and enjoy the ride.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Work Up a Sweat</h5>
        <p>
            For those who want more of a workout - think 60 to 100 km rides with real elevation gain, early starts, and
            long days. It’s a physical challenge, but still grounded in the scenery and spirit of the trip.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>More Than the Guide Can Handle</h5>
        <p>
            Believe it or not, we’re not racers - but sometimes our guests are. If you're looking to crush climbs or
            rack up big mileage, we won’t stop you! Just know that in these cases, we may split up - so the speed demons
            can fly while the rest of the group takes it easy. We’ll still support both paths.
        </p>
    </li>
