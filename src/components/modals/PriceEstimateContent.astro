<p>
    Planning a custom trip means every itinerary is a little different - and that’s the point. We don't use fixed
    packages because every traveler, group size, destination, and level of support is unique. That said, we understand
    that you probably want at least a sense of what to expect before getting started.
</p>

<p>
    We’re happy to talk through your ideas and provide a <span class="emph">no-obligation estimate</span> once we know the
    general outline of your trip. Our goal is to make rural Japan <span class="emph">accessible</span>, <span
        class="emph">affordable</span
    >, and <span class="emph">deeply memorable</span> - and we’ll always try to match your budget where possible.
</p>

<h3>What Affects the Price</h3>

<h4>Number of Participants</h4>
<p>
    We don’t have a flat per-person rate. <span class="emph">Families and small groups</span> are easier to price affordably,
    since logistics and guiding can be shared. <span class="emph">Solo travelers, couples, and groups of three</span> are
    also very welcome - we’ll do our best to make something work without compromising on experience.
</p>

<h4>Type of Accommodation</h4>
<p>
    We usually choose <span class="emph">small, family-run inns</span> or farmstays - warm, welcoming places that reflect
    the feel of the region. These are rarely <span class="emph">“luxury”</span> in the hotel sense, but offer something richer:
    simple, delicious meals and genuine hospitality. If you’re looking for high-end ryokan, we can arrange those too, though
    they will affect the total cost.
</p>

<h4>Location & Duration</h4>
<p>
    The total price depends on where the trip takes place, how far it is from our base in Northern Nagano, and how many
    days you're traveling. <span class="emph">Longer trips often have a lower daily cost</span> than short ones, especially
    if we’re traveling far to meet you.
</p>

<h4>Time of Year & Advance Notice</h4>
<p>
    <span class="emph">Spring and autumn</span> are peak seasons, and last-minute bookings can be tough. <span
        class="emph">Giving us more time to plan</span
    > helps us find the best accommodation and keep costs down.
</p>

<h4 class="price-title">Level of Support</h4><p>
    We also understand that not everyone wants (or needs) the same level of company or support. Some people enjoy having
    a guide by their side for meals and downtime, while others prefer more personal space. We're happy to adjust
    accordingly - whether that means joining you throughout the day or giving you room to explore and regroup at key
    points. These preferences don’t always make a huge difference in price, but they help us plan a trip that feels just
    right for you - both in experience and in budget.
</p>
<p>We offer different levels of involvement to suit your comfort and budget:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h5>Fully Guided</h5>
        <p>
            We’re with you the whole way - riding or walking alongside you, staying in the same inn, and sharing meals
            together. We guide at your pace, helping with check-ins, interpreting, and navigating local spots. Depending
            on group size or pace differences, we may occasionally split to accommodate different routes (like easy vs.
            hard options), but we’re always close and reconnect throughout the day.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Semi-Guided</h5>
        <p>
            You ride and explore independently, but our support vehicle follows just behind the scenes - meeting you
            throughout the day and always within a few minutes’ reach. We are there to handle logistics like luggage
            transfers, check-ins, and join you for museums and activities. Meals and evening time can be more private or
            shared, depending on your preference and budget. It’s a balance between freedom and support, with us never
            far away.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Self-Guided with Minimal Support</h5>
        <p>
            You’re free to travel at your own pace, using our detailed maps and GPS routes, with all accommodations
            arranged in advance. While the trip is self-guided, we stay close enough to assist when needed - including
            moving bikes and luggage between far-apart regions. This allows you to shift locations mid-trip, like
            spending a day in Nagano and the next on the Japan Sea coast, without being tied to a continuous cycling
            route.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Fully Self-Guided</h5>
        <p>
            We plan your route and assist with bookings, and you handle the trip on your own. We’re available by phone
            and can track your location in case of any issues. (See our <a href="/self-guided/" title=""
                >Self Guided page for details</a
            >)
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Want an Estimate?</h3>
<p>
    All of this will be clarified during the estimate process, so we can make sure we’re on the same page - both in
    terms of expectations and cost. It’s important to us that there are no surprises, and that you know exactly what’s
    included and how things will work throughout the trip.
</p>

<p>
    We can give you a ballpark once we know the rough outline - for example, a <span class="emph"
        >3-day self-guided trip for two in Nagano</span
    > will typically be around <span class="emph">¥XX,000–¥YY, </span>
