        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                Absolutely - solo trips are welcome, and we've helped many solo travelers explore Japan's countryside.
                That said, a few things to keep in mind:
            </p>
            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>
                    <strong>Self-guided plans are the most affordable.</strong>
                    <div>
                        If you don't need a guide or physical support on the ground, we can build a personalized
                        itinerary just for you.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Guided or supported solo trips may cost more.</strong>
                    <div>
                        Since the support isn't shared with a group, prices can be higher - but we'll always be upfront
                        about the options.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>We can try to match solo travelers.</strong>
                    <div>
                        If you're open to it, we may be able to pair you with another solo traveler to share costs - and
                        maybe even make a new friend.
                    </div>

            </ul>
            <p>
                We want everyone - even solo travelers - to have access to this kind of trip. Cost is the main barrier,
                but we'll do what we can to help make it work.

                Our trips are custom, and can be as short as 2 days or stretch into multi-week adventures. Here's a
                rough idea of what each length offers:
            </p>
            <ul class="trip-length-breakdown">
                <li>
                    <strong>2 days:</strong>
                    <div>
                        A nice introduction to the countryside - more immersive than a typical day trip from other tour
                        companies. Depending on your route, you may loop back to the starting point rather than head on
                        to the next location, which is totally fine if your goal is simply to get a taste.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>3 days:</strong>
                    <div>
                        A more balanced experience. You'll have time to settle into the slower rhythm, and at least one
                        full day will be deep in nature. Often gets you closer to your final destination, so at the end
                        of the trip you can hop a local train to the next spot on your itinerary. Having three days also
                        adds a buffer in case of weather.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        A three-day trip may look like departing from Kyoto by bike, one night in a small mountain
                        village, ride to the coast on day two, stay in a fishing village, and day three is riding along
                        the coast until it's time to catch a local train to Kanazawa.
                    </div>

                <li>
                    <strong>4–5 days:</strong>
                    <div>
                        The sweet spot for most travelers. Enough time to truly unwind, connect with the rhythm of rural
                        life, and more opportunities to enjoy organic, spontaneous moments. Great for families - kids
                        stay engaged, and parents get a break from the crowds.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        If you choose guided support, we're often able to help carry the load a bit - entertaining the
                        kids, watching out for them on the road, and giving parents a moment to relax.
                    </div>

                <li>
                    <strong>6–7 days:</strong>
                    <div>
                        Ideal for combining activities - like biking a few days, with two days of hiking to a mountain
                        hut. Lets you go slower without feeling like you're “wasting” time. Adds depth and variety to
                        the trip.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        Let's go big. Cover longer distances, explore multiple regions, and build something that feels
                        more like a journey than a vacation. A real sense of accomplishment by the end.

                milti-generational families, and everyone in between. Some guests ride 60km a day or more. Others prefer
                slow mornings, short walks, and soaking in an onsen before dinner.

                    <strong>Self-guided:</strong>
                    <div>
                        A fully custom itinerary, suggested accommodation and assistense with reservation, GPS maps,
                        detailed route notes, and ongoing advice by message. You travel at your own pace, with local
                        insight and planning handled for you - and help never far away if needed.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Semi-guided:</strong>
                    <div>
                        All of the above, plus luggage transfers, help coordinating lodgings, phone check-ins, and
                        occasional in-person support. We handle logistics, might join for key sections if you want, or
                        be just a few minutes away if needed. You will have more independent time.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        A guide is with you throughout - often riding or walking together, handling language and
                        logistics, and adjusting the plan as needed. We stay in the same accommodation, share and
                        explain meals, help facilitate interactions with the inn-keepers, and help make the experience
                        more relaxed, especially for families.

                <strong>Accommodation is not included</strong> in the base fee, since it varies by style and location. We'll
                help find and coordinate options to fit your budget - from local inns (¥8,000–¥12,000 per night with meals)
                to more upgraded or unique stays. Every route is custom, so while we have some favorites, there is nosingle
                list of pre-set hotels - just what fits your trip best.

    <summary><span>When is the best time to go?</span></summary>
<div class="answer">
  <p>Honestly? Anytime. Every season has something special  -  and we tailor trips to fit it.</p>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>
      <strong>Summer:</strong>
      <div>
        Yes, it's hot. But not everywhere. We plan trips to higher elevations, forested areas, and rivers.
        A shady hike or a post-ride soak makes all the difference.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Autumn:</strong>
      <div>
        Crisp air, changing leaves, and harvest season. It's popular, so we'll help navigate the crowds and
        secure the right stays.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Winter:</strong>
      <div>
        Great for quieter trips, citrus season, or snow walks in select regions. Coastal areas stay mild,
        and we'll equip you with warm, weatherproof gear.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Spring:</strong>
      <div>
        Yes, cherry blossoms  -  but also quiet roads, fresh greens, and rural life shaking off winter.
        There's more than just sakura.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rainy or Typhoon season:</strong>
      <div>
        Not as bad as people say. Rain brings atmosphere and drama. And if the weather turns? We pivot.
        It's part of the story.
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We'll help you choose the right region for the right season  -  and adjust plans as needed. Rural life
    goes on, rain or shine. So will your trip.

<!-- 
    <details open={isStatic}>
        <summary><span>How long are the trips?</span></summary>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                Trips can range from 2 days to 2 weeks or more  -  but most people find 4–6 days is the sweet spot. It's
                all flexible and built around your energy, interests, and available time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Want a 3-day ride from Kyoto to the coast, then hop a train to Kanazawa? Easy. Prefer a longer trip from
                Osaka to Hiroshima, mixing bike and local train as needed? No problem. We'll shape it to fit your pace
                and comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
                For walking trips, we skip long or urban stretches in favor of the most scenic sections, with options to
                use local trains or luggage shuttles for comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two-day trips are possible, but we recommend at least 3–4 days if you want to feel like you're truly
                going somewhere, not just looping back. The longer you go, the more there is to discover.
