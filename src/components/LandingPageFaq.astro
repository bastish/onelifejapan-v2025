        <summary><span>How much does it cost?</span></summary>
        <ul class="checklist">
            <li><strong>Self-guided planning:</strong> from ¥10,000/day<br /></li>
            <li><strong>Supported semi-guided:</strong> from ¥20,000/day<br /></li>

        </ul>
        <p>*Per person / per day</p>
        <p>
            Pricing depends on factors like how much support you want, if you're biking or walking, and the length of
            the trip. We work with your budget to create the best experience — without pushing anything you don’t need.

    <details open={isStatic}>
        <summary><span>How long are the trips?</span></summary>
        <p>Anywhere from 2 days to 1 month. Usually about 4 ~ 5 days. All flexible and tailored to your trip.</p>
        <p>
            Want a 3-day bike ride from Kyoto to the coast, then train to Kanazawa? Easy. Prefer a longer journey from
            Osaka to Hiroshima, mixing bike and local train as needed? No problem. We build it around your energy level
            and timing. Want to try, but unsure if you can make it the entire distance? No problem. Go as far as you can
            and local train will take you the rest of the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            For walking trips, we skip long or urban road stretches in favor of the most scenic sections. We can mix in
            local trains or luggage shuttles to keep the experience comfortable.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details open={isStatic}>
        <summary><span>How hard are the trips?</span></summary>
        <p>As hard — or as easy — as you want them to be.</p>
        <p>
            Some guests want full days of riding or hiking, others just a few scenic hours each morning. Rainy day? Skip
            ahead by train. Traveling with kids or grandparents? We’ll build in flexibility so everyone enjoys the pace.

        <p>
            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>Families, couples, and solo travelers.</li>

                <li>Travelers who want flexibility, not tour buses.</li>

    <details open={isStatic}>
        <summary><span>When should I book?</span></summary>
        <p>The earlier, the better — but last-minute can work too. If the dates are free, we’ll make it happen.</p>
        <p>
            For solo travelers, get in touch early and if there is enough time, we will try to find others to join your
            dates for company, and help keep the cost down.
