                    Worried that venturing off the Golden Route means missing its must-see highlights? Our detours deliver

                    crowded. Now is the best time to explore the quiet places before they are picked up on the tourism radar.

            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>
                    <strong>Summer:</strong> Higher elevations, shaded forests, rivers and waterfall climbing. We try our
                    hardest to keep you cool - heat is much less of an issue than in the cities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Autumn:</strong> Fall colors, crisp air, harvest season. Fall is peak time tourism time in Japan,
                    but out on the road, it often feels like you have the countryside to yourself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Winter:</strong> Our base is in snow country (3+ meters of snow!), but bike riding is possible
                    in many other areas of Japan. Coastal walks and rides stay mild, and soaking in an onsen after a winter
                    day out is unforgettable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spring:</strong>
                    In the mountains, cherry blossoms linger long after they vanish from the Golden Route. But spring isn't
                    just sakura - fresh green forests, farmers planting rice, newly opened hiking trails, and few crowds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rainy/Typhoon:</strong>
                    Not a deal-breaker. Rain often creates stunning scenery and cooler days. Even if a typhoon passes through,
                    waiting it out in a hot spring and watching the skies clear is a countryside experience in itself.
