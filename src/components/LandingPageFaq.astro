<div class="answer">
  <p>Honestly? Anytime. Every season has something special — and we tailor trips to fit it.</p>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>
      <strong>Summer:</strong>
      <div>
        Yes, it's hot. But not everywhere. We plan trips to higher elevations, forested areas, and rivers.
        A shady hike or a post-ride soak makes all the difference.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Autumn:</strong>
      <div>
        Crisp air, changing leaves, and harvest season. It’s popular, so we’ll help navigate the crowds and
        secure the right stays.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Winter:</strong>
      <div>
        Great for quieter trips, citrus season, or snow walks in select regions. Coastal areas stay mild,
        and we’ll equip you with warm, weatherproof gear.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Spring:</strong>
      <div>
        Yes, cherry blossoms — but also quiet roads, fresh greens, and rural life shaking off winter.
        There’s more than just sakura.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rainy or Typhoon season:</strong>
      <div>
        Not as bad as people say. Rain brings atmosphere and drama. And if the weather turns? We pivot.
        It’s part of the story.
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We’ll help you choose the right region for the right season — and adjust plans as needed. Rural life
    goes on, rain or shine. So will your trip.
  </p>

    <!-- 
    <details open={isStatic}>
        <summary><span>How long are the trips?</span></summary>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                Trips can range from 2 days to 2 weeks or more — but most people find 4–6 days is the sweet spot. It's
                all flexible and built around your energy, interests, and available time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Want a 3-day ride from Kyoto to the coast, then hop a train to Kanazawa? Easy. Prefer a longer trip from
                Osaka to Hiroshima, mixing bike and local train as needed? No problem. We’ll shape it to fit your pace
                and comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
                For walking trips, we skip long or urban stretches in favor of the most scenic sections, with options to
                use local trains or luggage shuttles for comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two-day trips are possible, but we recommend at least 3–4 days if you want to feel like you’re truly
                going somewhere, not just looping back. The longer you go, the more there is to discover.
