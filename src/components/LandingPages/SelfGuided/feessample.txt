Thought for a couple of seconds


Putting a flat fee on your self-guided planning isn’t just about the hours spent—it’s about the *type* of work and guarantees you provide. Here’s a rough way to frame the value:

| Work Component                         | Estimated Effort | Market Rate       | Line-Item Value      |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| 1. Route research & GPX creation       | 3–4 hours        | ¥7 000–10 000 /hr | ¥21 000–40 000       |
| 2. Availability checks & holds         | 2–3 hours        | ¥7 000–10 000 /hr | ¥14 000–30 000       |
| 3. Booking coordination (inns, bikes)  | 2–3 hours        | ¥7 000–10 000 /hr | ¥14 000–30 000       |
| 4. “How-to” guide & checklists         | 1–2 hours        | ¥7 000–10 000 /hr | ¥7 000–20 000        |
| 5. Remote support & last-minute tweaks | ongoing\*        | bundled           | —                    |
| **Subtotal**                           | **8–12 hours**   |                   | **¥56 000–¥120 000** |

\*Remote support (phone, email, pushed route changes) is hard to time-track cleanly, which is why a flat fee works best.

**Why ¥80,000 makes sense**

* It sits mid-range in the **¥56 k–120 k** bracket, so you’re not undercharging your prep work, but still giving a small “loyalty” discount versus simply billing at top hourly rates.
* It bundles in unlimited phone/email support and unlimited “last-minute” tweaks—something you’d otherwise have to cap or bill extra for if you clocked by the hour.
* It reflects the *guarantee* you’re providing: held rooms, reserved bikes, guaranteed workshop spots in tiny villages that sell out quickly.

**How to present it**

> **Self-Guided Planning: ¥80,000 per family**
> You get a full 4-day custom plan (GPX, maps, bookings held) plus unlimited remote support.
> On-ground costs (inns, meals, bikes, activities) you pay directly—roughly ¥45,000–¥55,000 pp.

Families see that **¥80k** buys them your entire expertise and peace of mind (no hidden hourly bills), which in the open market would cost them **¥56k–120k** all by itself.
