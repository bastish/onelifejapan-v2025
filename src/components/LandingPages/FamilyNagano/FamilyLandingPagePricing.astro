                        This itinerary was created with a guide in mind—Fully Guided and Self-Guided both work, but they
                        offer very different experiences:

                            <em>Fully Guided:</em> On-the-fly route tweaks, timing checks, and support-vehicle backup let
                            you stop or detour whenever you wish.<br />
                            <em>Self-Guided:</em> You follow a pre-planned route and keep your own schedule—ideal if you
                            enjoy self-navigation and exploration.

                            arranged—just show up and ride.<br />
                            <em>Self-Guided:</em> You pay inns (~¥10,000/night pp), meals (~¥5,000/meal pp), bike rental
                            (~¥5,000/day pp) and activities directly—while we handle all the pre-trip planning.

                            local experiences.<br />
                            <em>Self-Guided:</em> You receive insider tips and contact details—but arrange and pay for each
                            experience yourself.

            This isn’t a fixed tour package. The prices shown are realistic estimates based on our past trips — a guide
            to help you anticipate the overall cost of a private countryside experience with real hosts. We do our best
            to keep it family-friendly and flexible, and we’ll adjust the estimate if you choose to add more days or
            change the level of support.
