    <h4>Day 1</h4>
    <strong>Ride Directly From Your Hotel</strong>
    <p>Some people want to ride right from the hotel. Part of the adventure is to do limit non-self powered transit.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>08:00</strong> Your bikes are ready and course is set in the gps. Load luggage into the support van and
            set off right from your hotel.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>08:15</strong> Its not long before you are out of the city and into countryside roads.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>11:30</strong> Stop for some of the less visited temples north of Kyoto City, then lunch at a roadside
            resteraunt.
        </li>
        <li><strong>13:00</strong> Continue riding (or hop in the van/train to shortcut a hill).</li>
        <li>
            <strong>15:30</strong> Arrive at your countryside inn—check in, change into yukata, soak in the onsen.
        </li>
        <li><strong>17:00</strong> Wander the village streets on foot or relax on the porch with matcha.</li>
        <li><strong>18:30</strong> Multi‑course local dinner featuring seasonal produce.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Short Train to Departure - get out of the city first.</strong>
    <p>
        Some would rather skip the city part - especially if starting from Osaka, or maybe they want to start close
        enough to the destiantion that once they get on the bike, they can ride all the way without "cheating". Perhaps
        the goal is Tottori but you only have three days.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will meet you at a smaller train station on the outskirts of Kyoto or Osaka (or wherever). From there you can
        skip the city and start riding right in the Japan countryside .
    </p>
    <!-- <ul>
        <li><strong>07:00</strong> Catch a local train from Kyoto to a small station (≈ 40 min).</li>
        <li>
            <strong>07:45</strong> Drop bags at a locker or in the support van; quick orientation over coffee.
        </li>
        <li><strong>08:00</strong> Set off on a rolling loop through quiet villages and cedar forests.</li>
        <li><strong>12:00</strong> Lunch at a hidden family‑run soba shop (reservation made for you).</li>
        <li>
            <strong>13:30</strong> Complete the loop back at the station—store bikes and transfer to your inn.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>15:00</strong> Check in, freshen up, then stroll to the local onsen or visit a neighbor’s farm.
        </li>
        <li><strong>18:00</strong> Evening meal in a traditional farmhouse setting.</li>
    </ul> -->

    <h4>Day 2, 3, 4 ...</h4>
    <strong>A full day on the road.</strong>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Last Day.</h4>
    <p>You have spent three or four days riding, closer to your next destination, or maybe you reached it.</p>
    <p>
        We will be waiting wherever you decide to pack it in. You will get your luggage and hand back your bikes. Where
        you go from here is up to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps you hop a train for the last hour - skipping the gradually busiser roads. Maybe you get on a train and
        just head back to Kyoto, or wherever you started, feeling proud knowing that you had covered this distance under
        your own power.
    </p>
    <!-- <ul>
        <li>Wake at leisure, enjoy a final onsen soak.</li>
        <li><strong>10:00</strong> Load bikes and bags into the van.</li>
        <li><strong>10:30</strong> Transfer to the nearest hub station (train or private shuttle).</li>
        <li>
            <strong>11:00–14:00</strong> Train back to Kyoto (or onward to Kanazawa/Tokyo), with connections pre‑booked for
            you.
        </li>
    </ul> -->
