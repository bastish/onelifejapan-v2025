        <h2>Rooted in Rural Japan</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Kevin, the lead facilitator behind One Life Japan. Our home is a small farming village in Nagano's Snow
            Country, where I've spent nearly two decades living as part of the rural community - from farming my own
            rice, to serving on the local tourism board, volunteering on the fire brigade, and just foraging wild
            vegetables or sitting down for tea with neighbors.
        </p>

        <p>
            That long-standing connection to rural life, built through firsthand experience and understanding, shapes
            how I plan every trip. Along the way, I rely on a small circle of trusted local hosts, innkeepers, and
            neighbors who help bring each journey to life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether you're exploring Nagano or another countryside region, you'll experience the real rhythms of rural
            Japan - quiet roads, local meals, seasonal traditions, and and the kind of hospitality that comes from
            long-standing relationships - and knowing how to move respectfully and naturally within rural communities.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nestled in a small farming village in northern Nagano's Snow Country, we're part of daily village life - not
            outside observers. I farmed rice for ten years, volunteered on the fire brigade, served on the local tourism
            board, and still forage wild vegetables and mushrooms with neighbors. When you stay with us in Nagano, you
            join real routines: harvest festivals, school visits, meals in family homes too small for large tour groups.
            Those authentic connections - rooted in long‑standing relationships - aren't available to companies based
            elsewhere or to visitors who only pass through.

            Our home is in a small farming village in Northern Nagano's Snow Country. We are part of the community and
            don't just visit, from rice farming to working with local tourism board, and doing all the other things that
            people do in their real life in Japan. Our main focus has been on sharing country lifestyle, not adventure
            tourism. Kevin is the main facilitator, but he relies on a loose team of local's support, from inn-keepers,
            to neighbors who are willing to share their life

        <h2>Staying Small, Custom & Private First Since 2005</h2>

        <p>
            We've been organizing countryside trips in Japan since 2005 - starting small and staying that way on
            purpose. Our trips don't follow a script. Every one is unique - shaped around each traveler, each season,
            and what's possible in the moment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most journeys begin as private trips. If others want to join, we'll only combine groups when everyone
            agrees. That flexibility keeps things real - less like a tour, more like visiting a friend who lives there.
        </p>

        <p>
            We wish we could share this kind of travel with everyone - but it doesn't scale. And that's the point. The
            places we go, and the people we work with, thrive on trust and timing - not crowds or name recognition.
        </p>
        <!-- 
        <p>
            We've been guiding travelers through rural Japan for nearly two decades - starting with small, custom trips
            long before countryside travel became popular. Our very first tour in 2005 grew from a personal bikepacking
            journey that revealed just how special these lesser-seen regions are.
        </p>

        <p>
            My background includes Outward Bound guiding in the U.S. and Japan, sea-kayak instruction, canyoning in
            Nagano, organic rice farming, and Wilderness First Responder training. That mix of outdoor and cultural
            experience helps me navigate backroads, manage logistics, and share the details that make countryside travel
            meaningful - from mountain weather to seasonal customs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of Nagano, you still benefit from those years of experience. I may not know every local, but I know
            how to find them - and how to plan trips that reflect the real rhythms of village life, not just what's
            convenient for tourists.
        </p>

        <p>
            We've stayed intentionally small. While others scaled up during Japan's tourism boom, we found that intimacy
            and adaptability - not size - were what made our trips special. We still believe that today.
        </p> -->
        <!-- <p>
            Since organizing our first small‑group trip in 2005 - sparked by a bikepacking journey that opened our eyes to
            rural Japan - we've spent over 20 years refining countryside travel. My background includes sea‑kayak
            instruction, Outward Bound guiding in both the U.S. and Japan, canyoning in Nagano, Wilderness First
            Responder training, and organic rice farming. Those skills help me anticipate challenges, navigate
            back‑roads, and share the nuances of rural life - from mountain weather to seasonal customs.
        </p>
        <p>
            For regions outside Nagano, you benefit from my decades of exploration and deep understanding of Japanese
            village life. While I may not have every local contact, I know how to research and arrange authentic
            encounters - crafting trips that reflect true customs, landscapes, and rhythms, even beyond our home region.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our first trip with customers was in 2005. We started small and have stayed small. Even while the tourism
            boom happened around us, we found that growing meant giving up the intimacy we were able to offer. Even when
            competitors began popping up riding the tourism boom, we found that keeping small was what made our trips
            work.

        <h2>Staying Small, Custom & Private First</h2>
        <p>
            We design every trip around the people taking it - not a fixed tour schedule. Most start privately and stay
            that way. Sometimes solo travelers or couples ask to join others for a more social adventure, and we'll open
            that up only if everyone agrees. That's as “group tour” as we get.
        </p>

        <p>
            We wish we could share this kind of travel with everyone - but it doesn't scale well. The most meaningful
            countryside experiences come from trust, timing, and small moments that only happen when things stay
            flexible and personal. We keep it small so it stays real.
        </p>

        <p>
            Large tours are great for sightseeing, but they're not built for this. They can't reach the quiet places
            where people still live ordinary lives and welcome us in because they know us - not because we're part of a
            package.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your itinerary won't be set in stone - because rural life isn't. Whether you're into long rides, slow walks,
            history, farming, or just following your curiosity, we'll shape the trip around what fits you and what's
            happening locally at the time.
        </p>

    </div> -->

<!-- 

        <p>
            Despite the recent tourist boom, we deliberately limit group size to keep experiences genuine. In Nagano,
            our neighbors open their homes and fields; elsewhere, we partner with trusted, small‑scale hosts and guides.
            Every itinerary is bespoke: you choose activities and pace, and we leverage either our personal community or
            vetted local contacts to bring it to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the recent toursit boom, while other companies have expanded, we have kept our roots. This
            small‑group, private‑first approach ensures you won't get a standard “tour” feel - just authentic, flexible
            journeys that showcase rural Japan's heart, whether in our hometown or farther afield. Our goal is to make
            rural Japan and Japaneswe coutnryside experiences accesisble to anyonee regarldes sof budget.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have found that large group tours are great for gettin out to *see* rural Japan for photos, but they do
            not work well for getting down to real life. They also limit who can join, and orgnaizing for large groups
            limits the locations because it has to appeal to many, with the name value. We want to share the areas where
            people live like we know. Where tourism is not he main thing, and places where people will folow us not
            because it has a famous name, but because they trust us to show them a side of Japan they would not
            otherwise see.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years our local itineraries have become somewhat stable, but always still depend on the customer
            and what is happening at the time. We cannot offer a set in stone itinerary becuase it just wont work.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are private first, in that we will build the trip based on what the initial paricipants want. We are not
            against opening it up to others - but only if everyone agrees. Sometiems solo travlers, or couples would
            like to jin other travelers or couples for a more social adventure. That is as group-toury as we get.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trips can be lots of biking, very physically oriented, or very eassy, with a focus more on leasurly walking.
            Some people have speial interests and would rather get deeper into histoery, spendig more time in the museum
            than on the road. We can arrange that. Some are into farming or gardening and want to get muddy in the rice
            field. If the season is right, we can arrange that.
