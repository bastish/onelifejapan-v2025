        <h2>Live and Play Rural</h2>
        <p>
            Nestled in a small farming village in northern Nagano’s Snow Country, we’re part of daily village life—not
            outside observers. I farmed rice for ten years, volunteered on the fire brigade, served on the local tourism
            board, and still forage wild vegetables and mushrooms with neighbors. When you stay with us in Nagano, you
            join real routines: harvest festivals, school visits, meals in family homes too small for large tour groups.
            Those authentic connections—rooted in long‑standing relationships—aren’t available to companies based
            elsewhere or to visitors who only pass through.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our home is in a small farming village in Northern Nagano's Snow Country. We are part of the community and
            don't just visit, from rice farming to working with local tourism board, and doing all the other things that
            people do in their real life in Japan. Our main focus has been on sharing country lifestyle, not adventure
            tourism. Kevin is the main facilitator, but he relies on a loose team of local's support, from inn-keepers,
            to neighbors who are willing to share their life

        <h2>Organizing Trips in Rural Japan Since 2005</h2>
        <h2>Two Decades of Guiding with Local Expertise</h2>
        <p>
            Since organizing our first small‑group trip in 2005—sparked by a bikepacking journey that opened our eyes to
            rural Japan—we’ve spent over 20 years refining countryside travel. My background includes sea‑kayak
            instruction, Outward Bound guiding in both the U.S. and Japan, canyoning in Nagano, Wilderness First
            Responder training, and organic rice farming. Those skills help me anticipate challenges, navigate
            back‑roads, and share the nuances of rural life—from mountain weather to seasonal customs.
        </p>
        <p>
            For regions outside Nagano, you benefit from my decades of exploration and deep understanding of Japanese
            village life. While I may not have every local contact, I know how to research and arrange authentic
            encounters—crafting trips that reflect true customs, landscapes, and rhythms, even beyond our home region.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our first trip with customers was in 2005. We started small and have stayed small. Even while the tourism
            boom happened around us, we found that growing meant giving up the intimacy we were able to offer. Even when
            competitors began popping up riding the tourism boom, we found that keeping small was what made our trips
            work.
        </p>

        />
        <h2>Staying Small, Custom & Private First</h2>
        <p>
            Despite the recent tourist boom, we deliberately limit group size to keep experiences genuine. In Nagano,
            our neighbors open their homes and fields; elsewhere, we partner with trusted, small‑scale hosts and guides.
            Every itinerary is bespoke: you choose activities and pace, and we leverage either our personal community or
            vetted local contacts to bring it to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the recent toursit boom, while other companies have expanded, we have kept our roots. This
            small‑group, private‑first approach ensures you won’t get a standard “tour” feel—just authentic, flexible
            journeys that showcase rural Japan’s heart, whether in our hometown or farther afield. Our goal is to make
            rural Japan and Japaneswe coutnryside experiences accesisble to anyonee regarldes sof budget.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have found that large group tours are great for gettin out to *see* rural Japan for photos, but they do
            not work well for getting down to real life. They also limit who can join, and orgnaizing for large groups
            limits the locations because it has to appeal to many, with the name value. We want to share the areas where
            people live like we know. Where tourism is not he main thing, and places where people will folow us not
            because it has a famous name, but because they trust us to show them a side of Japan they would not
            otherwise see.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years our local itineraries have become somewhat stable, but always still depend on the customer
            and what is happening at the time. We cannot offer a set in stone itinerary becuase it just wont work.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are private first, in that we will build the trip based on what the initial paricipants want. We are not
            against opening it up to others - but only if everyone agrees. Sometiems solo travlers, or couples would
            like to jin other travelers or couples for a more social adventure. That is as group-toury as we get.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trips can be lots of biking, very physically oriented, or very eassy, with a focus more on leasurly walking.
            Some people have speial interests and would rather get deeper into histoery, spendig more time in the museum
            than on the road. We can arrange that. Some are into farming or gardening and want to get muddy in the rice
            field. If the season is right, we can arrange that.
