FOOTNOTES
---

* This trip is planned with families in mind, but we can also arrange similar custom trips for individual travelers.

* We work closely with local inns, farm inns, traditional ryokan, and family-run accommodations to find the best places to stay that fit your trip and ensure availability.

* The pricing estimate is based on at least double occupancy (two people sharing a room). If you would prefer individual rooms, please let us know during the planning process so we can adjust accordingly.

* Many accommodations are small inns or even farmers' homes, and in some cases, the entire house may be reserved for the group. Small families may share one room, while larger families and groups typically have two rooms or more when available. We will prioritize arrangements that allow for privacy when needed, such as for couples traveling together. Some inns may charge extra for additional rooms.

* A third room may sometimes be available at no extra charge depending on the specific inn’s policies and availability, but this cannot be guaranteed.

* This estimate includes guiding throughout the day, as well as staying and dining together at the same inns. For many families, this makes the experience even more memorable - sharing meals, playing games with the children, having conversations about country life, and helping connect with the inn hosts. If you prefer more private evenings, we’re happy to adjust the level of support to match your trip.

* Lunches are not included in the estimate, as lunchtime varies by day and is often flexible depending on the group's pace and preference.

* Transport to and from the trip starting and ending points is not included. We are happy to advise on the best routes if needed.
