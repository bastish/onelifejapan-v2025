We *ease into the final day* with a calm morning, a flexible ride through *mountain hamlets*, and a *make Japanese "e-tegami"* picture postcards of our memories. *After one last soak* in a quiet hot spring, we transfer to the train = or decdie to stay for one more night?


Our final day begins with a peaceful morning at the inn - you might *sleep in*, or step outside for a *walk in the cool mountain air* and soft light, or *help with breakfast*. After a home-style breakfast, we *make our own onigiri rice balls* for the day’s bento lunch - with *traditional fillings*, and maybe something more adventurous.

We then visit a *small lifestyle museum* and create our own e-tegami (painted postcards) - a *fun, creative way to reflect* on the trip and send a memory to someone you care about.

Afterward, we continue the ride, or maybe opt for a *hike or walk insead*. The exact course depends on your schedule and energy - from a *gentle valley loop* to a more *adventurous climb* and descent. There are options for *open air history museums* as well.

We have time to* finish with a soak* in a modern, uncrowded onsen, before *changing into clean clothes*, repacking and transferring to the train - or, if your trip allows, *staying one last night* in the countryside before heading onward.
